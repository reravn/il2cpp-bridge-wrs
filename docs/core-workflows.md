# Core Workflows

This page covers the workflows most adopters need after initialization: metadata lookup, method invocation, field and property access, Unity object access, and metadata dumping.

## Find Assemblies and Classes

Start with the cache:

```rust
use il2cpp_bridge_rs::api::cache;

let game = cache::csharp();
let player = game.class("PlayerController").expect("class should exist");
```

`Assembly::class` accepts either:

- `"Namespace.TypeName"`
- `"TypeName"` for the global namespace

Use `cache::assembly("Name")` for non-standard assemblies. The helper accepts names with or without the `.dll` suffix.

## Select Methods Safely

Use the narrowest selector that avoids ambiguity.

```rust
let by_name = player.method("Update");
let by_types = player.method(("TakeDamage", ["System.Single"]));
let by_count = player.method(("TakeDamage", 1));
```

Recommended practice:

- use name-only selectors for methods that are known not to be overloaded
- use parameter type selectors for stable overload resolution
- use parameter count selectors only when type names are inconvenient but overload count is still unambiguous

## Call Static vs Instance Methods

For static methods:

```rust
use std::ffi::c_void;

let factory = player.method("GetInstance").expect("static method should exist");
unsafe {
    let _instance_ptr: Result<*mut c_void, _> = factory.call(&[]);
}
```

For instance methods, bind through `Object::method` whenever possible:

```rust
use std::ffi::c_void;

if let Some(obj) = player.find_objects_of_type(false).into_iter().next() {
    let take_damage = obj
        .method(("TakeDamage", ["System.Single"]))
        .expect("instance method should exist");

    let amount: f32 = 25.0;
    unsafe {
        let _: Result<(), _> = take_damage.call(&[
            &amount as *const f32 as *mut c_void,
        ]);
    }
}
```

`Method::call` handles:

- static vs instance dispatch
- argument count checks
- reference-type vs value-type return handling
- managed exception conversion into `Err(String)`

## Read Fields and Properties

For fields:

```rust
if let Some(obj) = player.find_objects_of_type(false).into_iter().next() {
    let health = obj.field("health").expect("field should exist");
    unsafe {
        let current: f32 = health.get_value().expect("field read should succeed");
        println!("health = {}", current);
    }
}
```

For properties:

```rust
if let Some(obj) = player.find_objects_of_type(false).into_iter().next() {
    let enabled = obj.property("enabled").expect("property should exist");
    unsafe {
        let is_enabled: bool = enabled.get_value().expect("getter should succeed");
        println!("enabled = {}", is_enabled);
    }
}
```

Instance fields and properties require an instance pointer. `Object::field` and `Object::property` provide that automatically.

## Work with Unity Objects

`GameObject` and related wrappers sit on top of the metadata/object layer and are useful once you already have a live runtime object.

```rust
use il2cpp_bridge_rs::structs::GameObject;

if let Ok(player_go) = GameObject::find("Player") {
    let transform = player_go.get_transform().expect("transform should exist");
    println!("Found player object: {:?}", transform);
}
```

Use the wrapper layer when it makes common Unity operations clearer. Drop back to `Object`, `Class`, and `Method` when you need raw flexibility.

## Dump Metadata

The dump helpers generate C#-like pseudo-code from the hydrated cache.

```rust
use il2cpp_bridge_rs::api;

let _dump_dir = api::dump();
let _single_file = api::dump_all();
let _custom_dir = api::dump_to("/tmp/il2cpp_dump");
let _custom_file = api::dump_all_to("/tmp/il2cpp_dump");
```

These functions are useful for:

- offline analysis
- verifying cache hydration
- exploring unfamiliar assemblies
- building higher-level tooling on top of emitted pseudo-code

## Common Failure Shapes

Most workflow failures come from one of these conditions:

- `init` has not completed yet
- the wrong target image name was supplied
- the current thread is not attached to the IL2CPP VM
- a method overload was selected too loosely
- a field or property was accessed without a bound instance
- the expected Rust return type does not match the managed return shape

If you see one of those failure modes, resolve it before adding more wrapper code around the problem.
